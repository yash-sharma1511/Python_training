#  Understand the basics of variables, expressions, and statements in Python.

##  Variables in Python
  - A variable is a name that refers to a value stored in memory.
  - Python allows you to assign values to variables dynamically.

## 2.1.1.1 Expressions in Python
  - An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that Python evaluates to produce another value.  

## 2.1.1.1.Statements in Python
  - A statement is an instruction that Python executes. Statements do not necessarily return a value.

## 2.1.1.2. Differentiate between data types and apply type conversions. 
   - Integer (int)	x = 10	
   - Float (float)	y = 3.14	
   - String (str)	name = "Alice"	
   - Boolean (bool)	flag = True	
   - List (list)	nums = [1, 2, 3]	
   - Tuple (tuple)	t = (1, 2, 3)	
   - Set (set)	s = {1, 2, 3}	
   - Dictionary (dict)

# Values and Data Types
  - A value in Python is any piece of data that can be stored in a variable or used in an expression. Every value belongs to a specific data type, which determines how the value can be used in operations.

# Arithmetic Operators 
  - Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numbers.
  - Addition (+) → Adds two numbers.
  - Subtraction (-) → Subtracts one number from another.
  - Multiplication (*) → Multiplies two numbers.
  - Division (/) → Divides one number by another and returns a float.
  - Floor Division (//) → Divides and returns only the integer part (truncates decimal).
  - Modulus (%) → Returns the remainder of division.
  - Exponentiation (**) → Raises one number to the power of another.

# Comparison Operators
  - Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).
  - Equal to (==) → Checks if two values are equal.
  - Not equal to (!=) → Checks if two values are not equal.
  - Greater than (>) → Checks if the left value is greater than the right.
  - Less than (<) → Checks if the left value is smaller than the right.
  - Greater than or equal to (>=) → Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right.
  - Less than or equal to (<=) → Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right.

#  Logical Operators 
  - Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.
  - AND (and) → Returns True if both conditions are True, otherwise False.
  - OR (or) → Returns True if at least one condition is True.
  - NOT (not) → Reverses the Boolean value (True becomes False and vice versa).

##  Data Types
  - Python is dynamically typed, meaning that variables do not have a fixed type. Instead, the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the assigned value.

# Function Calls
- In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments.
- Type Conversion Functions
- Python provides built-in functions like int(), float(), and str() to handle type conversions.
- Python defines type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another.
- Implicit Type Conversion -- The Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another without any  user improvement.
- Explicit Type Conversion -- The data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement.

#  Variables
  - Python manages memory dynamically using reference counting and garbage collection. When a variable is created, Python
  - Allocates memory for the object.
  - Stores the object in memory and assigns it a unique ID.
  - References the object using the variable name.

# Statements and Expressions
  - An expression is any combination of values, variables, and operators that produces a result (a value). Expressions are evaluated and return a value.
